# SpacetimeGD (Example)

This is a bare bones exmaple that loosely follows the [SpacetimeDB Getting Started Docs](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/getting-started) and translating it into a gdext project.

You can simply clone this repo and run it like an other gdext project, assuming that you've already followed the gdext book, and the SpacetimeDB getting started section in order to run the Godot project and SpacetimeDB locally. This repo is not setup to be run in production! It is only intended for answering the question of how to implement SpacetimeDB into a Godot project using gdext.
