# SpacetimeGD (Example)

This is just an example repo on how I found a way to do a basic implementation of SpacetimeGD into the Godot game engine through `godot-rust/gdext`. If you want to use a template that has a premade project structure to use SpacetimeGD with Godot + gdext, please check out the [template repo](https://github.com/2-3-5-41/spacetime-gdext) and see what you can create!
